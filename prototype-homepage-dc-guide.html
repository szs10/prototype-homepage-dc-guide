  		<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> Independently own coffee shop well located for Judiciary Square and 
  		<br> surroundings. I do love that this little place delivers on two things I want <br> done well: coffee and pastries. The vibe here is definitely hipster and you <br> can tell it's and older place, but ultimately it's cozy and has a lot of natural <br>light in a central location. Learn more here.

  		<div style="margin-top: 10px;">This is the ultimate reputable DC coffee spot and bakery that fully lives up <br> to its level of hype. They have a large assortment of drinks, pastries and <br> other baked goods. Although it is in a bit of a less happening neighborhood <br> near union station, it's worth going out of your way for the bread and coffee here. <br> Learn more here.</div>

  	<li style="margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 5px;">Le Pain Quotidien</li>

  		<div style="margin-top: 10px;">It's a massive space made of wood with a lot of natural light. You can either <br> walk up to the bakery and order a cup of coffee and chocolate croissant or you <br> can wait to be seated in one of their many booths. The only bad thing is that <br> it is a little pricy. Learn more here.</div>
