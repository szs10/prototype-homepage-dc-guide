  <h1>Where should I study?</h1>
  <h3>Aka coffee shops and study spots for when you need a change of scenery.</h3>
   <ul>
  	<li>Bakers & Baristas</li>
  		Independently own coffee shop well located for Judiciary Square and surroundings. I do love that this little place delivers on two things I want done well: coffee and pastries. The vibe here is definitely hipster and you can tell it's and older place, but ultimately it's cozy and has a lot of natural light in a central location. Learn more here.
  	<li>A Baked Joint</li>
  		This is the ultimate reputable DC coffee spot and bakery that fully lives up to its level of hype. They have a large assortment of drinks, pastries and other baked goods. Although it is in a bit of a less happening neighborhood near union station, it's worth going out of your way for the bread and coffee here. Learn more here.
  	<li>Le Pain Quotidien</li>
  		It's a massive space made of wood with a lot of natural light. You can either walk up to the bakery and order a cup of coffee and chocolate croissant or you can wait to be seated in one of their many booths. The only bad thing is that it is a little pricy. Learn more here.
